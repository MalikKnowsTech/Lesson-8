    <h1>Hi, I'm Malik Lisbon.</h1>

    <hr>

        <p>
            My name is Malik Lisbon. I’m originally from the Bronx, NY but now live in New Jersey. <br> I am a demonstrated strong leader professional and have earned 2 Bachelor’s of Science (Psychology, Sociology) in May 2019, as well as my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification (Jan 2022). <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            In nearly every job I’ve held, I was offered a promotion in 6 months of employment or less. Even in new fields, my eagerness and willingness to learn propel me to stand out amongst peers. I hold excellent customer service, problem-solving, communicative, and accountability skills. Past experiences include the responsibility of training and instilling a solid foundation based on best practices, to ensure the creation of an organized team that produces results. 
            <br>
        </p>
         <p>
            Currently studying Python (100 Days of Code Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu).
